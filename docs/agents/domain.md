# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root — the domain glossary and context overview.
- **`docs/adr/`** — read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill (reached via `/grill-with-docs` and `/improve-codebase-architecture`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

This is a single-context repo:

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
│   ├── 0001-network-detail-as-server-tab.md
│   ├── 0002-update-frames-carry-live-metrics.md
│   └── ...
├── crates/        ← Rust workspace (common, server, agent)
└── apps/          ← web SPA, docs site, iOS client
```

The Cargo workspace and `packages/*` split are build-level modularity, not separate bounded contexts — server, agent, and web all share the one protocol/domain described by the root `CONTEXT.md`.

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal — either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders) — but worth reopening because…_
